> **Developer Note**: This document contains both technical development information and marketing materials. Scroll down for business overview or continue reading for technical setup.

## 🔧 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) - Ethereum development toolkit
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) with submodule support
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ (for frontend development)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kevanbtc/fth-gold.git
cd fth-gold

# Initialize git submodules (dependencies)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install Foundry if not already installed
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Build the smart contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test

# Run tests with detailed output
forge test -vvv

# Check gas usage
forge snapshot

# Format code
forge fmt
```

### Project Structure

```
contracts/
├── access/          # Access control and role management
├── compliance/      # KYC and regulatory compliance
├── libs/           # Shared libraries (Errors, Events)
├── oracle/         # Price feeds and Proof of Reserve
├── staking/        # USDT staking and lock mechanism
└── tokens/         # FTH-G token and stake receipts

script/             # Deployment scripts
test/               # Test files
lib/                # External dependencies (git submodules)
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to contracts in `contracts/`
2. **Compile** with `forge build`
3. **Test** with `forge test`
4. **Deploy locally** with `anvil` (local testnet)
5. **Deploy to testnet** using deployment scripts

### Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# RPC URLs
MAINNET_RPC_URL=
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=
POLYGON_RPC_URL=

# Private keys (for deployment)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=

# API keys
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=

# Contract addresses (after deployment)
ADMIN_MULTISIG=
TREASURY_ADDRESS=
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-path test/FTHGold.t.sol

# Run with gas report
forge test --gas-report

# Run with coverage
forge coverage
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to local testnet (anvil)
anvil  # In separate terminal
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url localhost

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY --verify
```

### Contract Architecture

- **FTHGold**: ERC20 token representing gold ownership (1 token = 1 kg)
- **StakeLocker**: Main contract for USDT staking → 5-month lock → FTH-G conversion
- **KYCSoulbound**: Soulbound NFT for KYC compliance
- **ComplianceRegistry**: Global compliance rules and jurisdiction management
- **Oracle contracts**: Price feeds and Proof of Reserve verification

### Security Features

- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Pausable functionality
- ✅ Multi-signature requirements
- ✅ Oracle staleness checks
- ✅ Coverage ratio enforcement
- ✅ Input validation and bounds checking

## 🎯 Meeting Strategy

### Opening Statement (30 seconds)
*"I've built what normally requires 100 engineers and $100 million. Third-party appraisal: $425-685 million for infrastructure alone. Add our 75-token economy: $2 billion total value. Unlike every blockchain project you've seen—this isn't a roadmap. Everything is live today."*

1. **Overview**: Third-party validation, verified holdings, efficiency metrics
2. **Infrastructure**: 6 L1s, compliance, RWA systems, enterprise applications
3. **Valuation**: Independent appraisal, cost comparisons, strategic ceiling
4. **Monetization**: Infrastructure + token economy revenue streams
5. **Token Economy**: 75+ tokens, marketing automation, enterprise services
6. **Rarity**: Solo achievement vs 100-person teams, competitive advantages

### Closing Statement (30 seconds)
*"This isn't a funding request—it's a partnership opportunity for infrastructure that competitors would take 5 years and $300 million to attempt, plus a token economy they can't replicate. Revenue starts immediately. Everything is ready today."*
